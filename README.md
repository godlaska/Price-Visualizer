## 🔧 Installation Instructions (Windows)

### 1. Install MySQL Workbench and MySQL Server

Before you can run the Price Visualizer application, you must install a Database Management Software (DBMS). We will be using **MySQL**, which requires two components:

- **MySQL Workbench** – A GUI to interface with the database  
- **MySQL Server** – The actual database server running locally on your machine

#### 🔹 Step 1: Install MySQL Workbench

Download the MySQL Workbench for Windows from the following link:

👉 [MySQL Workbench Download](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/)

- Choose your operating system (Windows) from the drop-down menu.
- Follow the installation instructions provided.
- This GUI tool will allow you to run queries, visualize schema, and manage your database easily.

#### 🔹 Step 2: Install MySQL Server (Local)

Download the MySQL Server using the MySQL Installer:

👉 [MySQL Installer for Windows](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/8.0.html)

- Select the "Developer Default" option during installation to include the necessary tools.
- When prompted, choose **a simple password** for the root user (e.g., `pass`).
  - ⚠️ **Important:** Don’t forget this password. You’ll need it to connect the Java application to the database.
  - This server will run **locally** and is **not internet-accessible**, so security complexity is not necessary.

## 🗃️ Importing Data into MySQL

Once MySQL Workbench and Server are installed, follow these steps to set up your database schema and import the project data.

### 1. Create the Schema

1. Open **MySQL Workbench** and start the **local MySQL server**.
2. Go to `File > New Query Tab`.
3. In the editor, paste the following SQL command:
   ```sql
   CREATE SCHEMA foodprices;
   ```
4. Click the ⚡ (lightning bolt) icon to run the command.
5. Click the gray refresh arrow next to Schemas.
6. You should now see a new schema named **foodprices**.
7. Right click the schema and click 'Set as Default Schema'

### 2. Run the Table Setup Script

1. Download the repository as a .zip file. Extract the folder in any place. This tutorial will assume it's in the Downloads folder.
2. Navigate to the following folder in your file explorer:
   ```
   Price-Visualizer-master/Price-Visualizer-master/sql/automaticSetup.sql
   ```
3. Open `automaticSetup.sql` and copy all the `CREATE TABLE` statements inside.
4. Go back to your MySQL Workbench window and make sure the `foodprices` schema is selected.
5. Paste the copied SQL commands into the query editor at the top.
6. Highlight all the `CREATE TABLE` commands and click the ⚡ (lightning bolt) icon to run them.

<p>Hit the refresh arrow in schemas and your tables should look like this:</p>

### 3. Load CSV Data into Tables

1. Open **Command Prompt**.
2. Use `cd` to navigate to the MySQL binary directory:
   - You can find it by launching MySQL, opening **Task Manager**, right-clicking on MySQL Workbench, and selecting **Open file location**.
   - Example path:
     ```
     cd "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Workbench 8.0 CE"
     ```

3. Launch the MySQL CLI with file loading enabled:
   ```
   mysql --local_infile=1 -u root -p
   ```
4. Enter your password (e.g., `pass`).
5. Enable file loading
   ```
   set global local_infile=true;
   ```
7. Select your schema:
   ```sql
   USE foodprices;
   ```

8. Open load_all_data.sql. This should open mySQLWorkbench. You'll notice each table has "LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE" then a path to a .csv. Make sure you change the path for each LOAD DATA query. All the data tables can be found in the /dataset folder.
  - 💡Tip: Right click on each CSV and click 'Copy as Path'. Paste that into the SQL file. From there, you can use that path for the rest of the CSVs. Make sure any backslashes (\\) are changed to forwardslashes (/)!
  - Once all of the paths are correct, press Ctrl+S to save. This should update the load_all_data.sql file in the folder. Yours should look similar to the image below ⬇️

10. To load the data, run the following:
   ```sql
   SOURCE C:\Users\[YOUR USERNAME]\Downloads\Price-Visualizer-master\Price-Visualizer-master\sql\load_all_data.sql
   ```
   - Make sure to **adjust the path** if your SQL file is in a different location.
   - 💡 Tip: once you navigate to the load_all_data.sql file, right click and click "Copy as Path". You can use this in front of SOURCE.
   - This script contains all `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE` commands to populate your tables from CSV files.
